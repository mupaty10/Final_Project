Project Title:
Develop Machine Learning Model to predict air quality in Kigali City
Project overview:
This project was to develops a machine learning–based approach to forecast PM2.5 air pollution levels in Kigali City up to six hours ahead. Using historical air quality data, temporal feature engineering, and tree-based models, the study evaluates the effectiveness of Random Forest and XGBoost models in capturing diurnal pollution patterns to support early warning and air quality management
